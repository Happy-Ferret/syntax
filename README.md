# Storyscript Syntax Highligting

Powered by [Iro][0], a DSL for generating cross-platform syntax highlighting.

## Usage
This package is distributed with IDE packages/extensions/plugins.

## Development
1. Navigate to [Iro][0] in your prefered web browser. Copy and paste the [`storyscript.iro`](https://github.com/storyscript/syntax-highlighter/blob/master/storyscript.iro) file into the Iro console on the left.
2. Copy the contents of [`syntax.story`](https://github.com/storyscript/syntax-highlighter/blob/master/syntax.story) to get a complete example of Storyscript syntax.
3. Make changes to the Iro file. Tap `cntr-s` to save and preview changes on the right.
4. Once complete, save changes once more. Tab over to each file and update the `./dist/...` folder with the changes to all distributions.
